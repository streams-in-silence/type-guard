# Typeguards
Bring easier type checks to your TypeScript project with `typeguards`. This library provides many utility functions that are simple wrappers around easy JavaScript built-in checks.

All this library does is wrap repetitive checks into simple little functions so you don't have to. Under the hood it looks like this:

```typescript
export function isString(value: unknown): value is string {
    return typeof value === "string";
}
```

## Installation
Use your favorite package manager to add to typeguards your project.

npm:
```bash
npm install typeguards
```

yarn:
```bash
yarn add typeguards
```

## Usage
```ts
import { isString } from "typeguards";

function getOptionalString(): string | undefined {}

const maybeString = getOptionalString();

if(isString(maybeString)) {
    // definitely a string here
    maybeString.toLowerCase();
}
```
